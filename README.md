# My-Dev-Containers
This is a repository that will store the boilerplate files to start coding projects in different languages and frameworks.

I want this repository to also act as guide for compiling and running the language or framework and point to learning resources for them.

## Using these devcontainer
1. Clone this repository
2. Remove the folder of the environment that you want to use and delete the repo.
